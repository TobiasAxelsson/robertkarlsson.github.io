			<p class="intro">
				I am a young and forward-looking Web-enthusiast with a keen interest in development and education. Right now I'm a head teacher at ZoCom and have responsibility for all of our educations towards vocational universities. 
        </p>
      <p class="intro"> 

With the web only being past its late teens people who choose to learn how to "create" it need to have a burning heart for the subject to keep up with its rapid evolution. I've grown up alongside this way of communication and I think our stages in life match each other pretty good. We've gone from not knowing anything about how to structure things properly, style our selves or interact with people to actually handle those things pretty good.
        </p>
      <p class="intro">

I think of education as something that needs to be highly practical and connected to where the industry stands today. The web is always evolving and my goal is to age alongside it, together with other developers.
